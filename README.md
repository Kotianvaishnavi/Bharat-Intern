Stock prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a popular application of deep learning in the financial domain. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.
LSTM models work by learning patterns and relationships in historical stock price data and using that information to make predictions about future stock prices. These models take as input a sequence of historical stock prices along with other relevant features, such as trading volume and technical indicators. The network's architecture allows it to remember long-term dependencies, making it effective for capturing trends and patterns in stock price data.
